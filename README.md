FITNESS GOAL is a real-time event management application designed specifically for fitness-related events, with Salesforce APIs(SOAP/REST) integration for seamless communication with external systems. This powerful platform allows you to easily manage event registration, schedule sessions, manage speakers, and track attendee information, all in one place. The application is built on the Salesforce platform using a combination of Apex, Lightning Components, Triggers, SOQL, and the Lightning App Builder. In addition to development technologies, FITNESS GOAL also requires various administrative components, including custom tabs, profiles, OWD (Organization-Wide Defaults), and roles, to manage user access to the platform, control the visibility of data, and define custom fields and objects. Whether you are an event manager or an administrator, FITNESS GOAL provides a user-friendly interface for managing all aspects of your event. With real-time integration capabilities, you can be sure that your data is always up-to-date and accurate, and that you can quickly respond to any changes or updates in your external systems.
